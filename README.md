##Abstract
> Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. - Wikipedia  

Music is a way to express and share. It brings people together around a common focus. In ancient Greece, 
music is the most beautifl of the arts. Along with a science, it is the object of high philosophical speculation. The Greeks
are indeed the first people who have established real concerts, which contributed to the developpement of a socially 
conscious public actively participating in the hearing.

Through the ages, genres fall and rised, music has greatly evolved. However, the manner of celebrating and listening to music
 remained the same : the concerts.
 The goal of this project is to study the dynamics of music in Switzerland in recent decades, by studying the evolution of genres
 and number of auditors in concerts and major musical events.


##Data Description
###List of concert places

A first approach will be to use existing event websites to grab informations about the musical scene in Switzerland. We plan to get a list of all locations were we can attend a concert. Using the plateform Resident Advisor, we can a good list of clubs and concerts hall in Switzerland. The website contains all line-ups of the concerts that have been announced through RA since 2006, giving us approximately 10 years of data. As the plateform is mainly electronic music oriented, the data will be mostly related to Techno scenes and Electro clubs.
